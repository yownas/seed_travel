# Seed Travel
Small script for AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui to create images that exists between seeds.

Will let you pick two seeds (or more) and then create a number of images while it morph between the two points of noise generated.

Samplers that work well are: Euler, LMS, Heun, DPM2 & DDIM.

(Batch Count will be ignored and set to 1.)

# Installation
1. Copy the file in the scripts-folder to the scripts-folder from https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui
2. Add `moviepy==1.0.3` to requirements_versions.txt

# What is "seed traveling"?
To understand what "seed traveling" is I first have to give a very very simplified explaination of how Stable Diffusion generates pictures.
It starts with noise and then tweak and poke it until it gets an image that looks like something that match the prompt you gave. And to get all this initial noise you use a seed. The seed is used to generate a bunch of random numbers which will be your inital noise. A different seed generates a different set of random numbers.

The problem is that the seed is a 32 bit value, around 4 billion different possible values. Which is a lot, but it is infinitesimal compared to the possible initial noises.

If we imagine all the possible noises as a map, a seed could be seen as one single point on that map. A huge universe with only a few possible places to stand and look at it. What seed traveling lets you do is to pick two "points" on this map and then travel between them, each step a new variation of noise that no one could ever reach by only using a seed.

So, interpolating between the noise from two seeds will not only look cool as a video, you will also get images you might never have seen.
